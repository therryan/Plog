== BUGS ==
- When database is initialized (by init.php), it doesn't check whether they already exist
- When a language is created, the abbreviation is always the first two letters, when
		in fact the user should have to able to specify it themselves
- Languages beginning with the same first two letters cannot be added (short_name is UNIQUE)
- If the same language is added a second time, the program crashes because it tries to create a table already in existence
- If there's an error in deleteLanguage and a language is only partly deleted, both addLanguage and deleteLanguage stop working, because they try to create things that already exist or remove things that have already been deleted

== FEATURES ==

	= UI =
		- The following pages have no UI:
			- add.php
			- index.php

- Tags
- Dreams?
